The past 20 years of Incheon Airport, which began with ground work in 1992, was one of challenges and successes.

We will embrace our 20-years success to take on the challenges of tomorrow. We will create anew the next 20 years as the global Hub Airport and the world class public corporation that rewrites the future of the aviation industry.
