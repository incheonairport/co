          Hello,  I am Il-Young Jung, the CEO of the Incheon International Airport Corporation.
        </p>

        <p class="mt30">
          Incheon Airport has continually grown with the goal of being the hub airport of East Asia and became an airport raking 7th in passenger served and 2nd in cargo processing in the world. Through putting the safety and the comforts of our customers above all, more than 40,000 airport family members have worked together to achieve the honor of being the best service airport in the world for 12 consecutive years.
        </p>

        <p class="mt30">
          We do not want to dwell in our past achievements but to continue to reach new heights. We will push forward to bring in the newest IT and bio technologies to create a futuristic smart airport and successfully complete the Stage 3 construction project as a step to becoming the world-class hub airport. We will also rise to the center of aviation, tourism, and culture in East Asia through building the AirCity, which will be the first of its kind in the world where resort and commercial complexes are combined into one.
        </p>

        <p class="mt30">
          Please continue to show your support and encouragement so that Incheon Airport can become a global airport corporation that will become a hub of the international skies and continue to develop and contribute to the international aviation business.
        </p>

        <p class="mt30">
          Thank you.
        </p>
