        <div class="co-traces font18">
          <p> Incheon International Airport construction project in an effort to build a 24-hour East Asia hub airport and respond to the steep growth of airport demand. Despite advice that it is
            difficult, even impossible, Yeongjongdo Island was deemed the ideal location, and with the groundbreaking in 1992, a new history was written. The most advanced construction methods and IT
            system were incorporated in building the airport facility. The national project that took astronomically number of people and equipment was completed 85 months after the site building work
            (101 months total) on March 29, 2001 as the first of its kind, and it has become the pride of the country. </p>

        <div class="co-traces font18">
          <p> To gain a competitive advantage in response to exponential growth of airport demand by building the East Asia&rsquo;s hub airport, Stage 2 construction began in 2002. The focus of the
            construction was 4,000m runways for aircrafts, cargo terminal, concourse, and other state-of-the-art facilities required for a global transit hub. Stage 2 was completed in 2008, which
            became the stepping stone for future growth of the top-tier airport with high-tech system and service. </p>

        <div class="co-traces font18">
          <p> Despite hardships and severe conditions after the opening, Incheon International Airport has grown to be number 8 in the world for number of passengers and number 3 in the world for
            cargo load. To continue this steady development, Stage 3 construction, begun in 2009, is full of will and vision of a 2nd opening of a world-class luxury airport. Upon completion of Stage
            3, which included Passenger Terminal 2, Transit Center 2, railroad tracks, road, and other transportation access system, Incheon International Airport became the global hub airport that
            can accommodate 72 million passengers and 5.8 million ton of cargo yearly. </p>
