              Through runway and parking ramp analysis, Incheon International Airport directs the aircrafts to the shortest travel route in an effort to reduce fuel-use and greenhouse gas emission. The parking ramp is built and spots assigned close to the most frequently used runway to reduce aircraft travel distance.

              Incheon International Airport is the first in the country to use AC-GPS to supply power to aircrafts that is parked on ground, and there is effort to expand the use of this technology. Aircraft power supply method is divided largely into 3: APU(Auxiliary Power Unit), GPU(Ground Power Unit), and AC-GPS(AirCraft Ground Power Supply). Among them, AC-GPS method directly provides power to aircraft, which reduces harmful and greenhouse gas emission, and it can reduce up to 98% of emission when compared to APU method and 86%-90% compared to the GPU method.

        <p>
          Incheon International Airport Corporation began the Green Cargo Hub Project in 2009. Incheon International Airport researched way to work with operating airlines and shipment companies to develop Unit Load Device (ULD), develop biodegradable packaging for cargo shipment, and reduce greenhouse gas emission. ULD is produced using special fabric and  synthetic resins, and it has replaced about 60% of the traditional steel-based ULD, and the biodegradable vinyl packaging material is an innovative method to reduce waste. Incheon International Airport Corporation has staked its claim at the head of the “green wave” through the development of the Green Cargo Hub brand, and we were awarded the “2014 Green Supply Chain Award” as an organization.

        <p>
          Incheon International Airport Corporation created an environment-friendly transportation system for airport users, resident business employees, and local community members. We encourage the use of bikes by creating a 18.4km bike lane between Incheon International Airport and New Town. And according the regulation that a public corporation must substitute more than 50% of its vehicles to environment-friendly car (40% electric car), we are increasing our share of environment-friendly cars and increasing the charging stations.

        <p>
          Incheon International Airport Corporation opened the Maglev Train route between the Transit Center and Yongyu Station (Stage 1 - 6.1km) in 2015. Maglev Train operates by electromagnetic force that elevates the train above the rain. There is no direct contact between the train and the rail, so there is very little noise or vibration. By 2020, the Stage 1 route between the Airport Transit Center ad Yongyu Station will be extended to the Parking Lot, International Business Complex (9.7km) and between the International Business Complex and Incheon International Airport (37.4km) in Stage 3.

              As a central gateway to Korea, Incheon International Airport promotes the “World Peace Forest Project” in the parks around the airport. We have partnered with a community organization since 2007 to create green areas, which not only reduces greenhouse gases, but also reduces noise level and provides shelter as well as a place of rest for community members.  The World Peace Forest, which will be completed over 3 stages in 2017 covering 470,000㎡, will serve as a place of biology field education, conservation of natural ecosystem, and enrichment of the local community.
